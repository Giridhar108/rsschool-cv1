3. My goal is to become a programmer and grow in this field, front-end development. At school I wanted to become a programmer, but at the last moment I went to another specialty. Now I decided to change my profession. I liked programming, took programming courses at school, studied in an information class.
My strong point is that if I took on a problem, I solve it to the end, I don't switch to other things. Weak side - "inattention"
Now I made one order for the site, 2 more are in development. I found clients myself and sold them sites before I learned how to make them :) Therefore, there is nowhere to retreat.
4. HTML, CSS, Figma.
